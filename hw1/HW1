Any program has same difference:
1. Linux usage description is isolated function inside C file. NetBSD only offers basic usage and use man instead.

Program I: date.c

Common:
1. Both of them are able to output different date format.
2. Both of them outputs are same when there is no any option.

Difference:
1. Linux error handler inside main function, but NetBSD has separate function.
2. Linux can accept --date option like '1 days ago', but NetBSD accept option like -v -1y(+1d).
3. Linux accept different date standard and use struct to defined long options, like iso-8601 or rfc-822. But NetBSD doesn't.

Program II: echo.c

Common:
1.Both of them are able to output message.
2.Both of them offers option to don't output newline.

Difference:
1. Linux offers options -e to enable interpretation of backslash escapes and -E to disable interpretation of backslash escapes, 
but NetBSD default to disable interpretation of backslash escapes, and doesn't offer any options.
2. Linux use fputs(argv[0], stdout) function to output result, but NetBSD use fflush(stdout);
