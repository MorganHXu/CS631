###Summary

The objective of this assignment is for you to get used to read (and understand!) code. To this end, please take a look at the NetBSD source code for programs installed under
`/bin`, pick two programs of your liking and inspect the code. Then, read the corresponding code of the same programs in Linux or Open Solaris Illumos. Compare the different implementations. What do they have in common? What makes them different?
